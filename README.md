# Dotfiles

A  repository that hosts the dotfiles for my Ubuntu workstations and a Termux development environment.

## Todo
Installation scripts will be coming soon that will allow for a turnkey solution for fresh operating systems that may not have desirable defaults.

Those scripts will start in a platform and operating system dependent way; however, as time goes on, these scripts will be able to run regardless of CPU architecture or operating system.
