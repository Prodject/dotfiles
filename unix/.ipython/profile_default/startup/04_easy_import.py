""" Import the most frequently used modules in the std lib.

Should I echo out what I'm importing? Will that be too noisy?

Maybe save all mods as strings in a list and offer to print if someones curious.

Also are these files executed directly? Sourced? Can I put the if __name__ block
in? Would that do anything?
