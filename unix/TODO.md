# TODO

So I just shifted my Kubuntu setup to run i3 as the WM and urxvt as the shell.
Also trying to put i3wm on Termux. As a result a lot of changes are gonna be
coming, but I won't have time to work on it regularly. Here's the list.

Refactor init.vim and vimrc. This is going to take so long that it'd be a waste
to elaborate much for now. However, the ideal [and this genuinely might take the
better part of the year] is to get nvim to the point where it's just sourcing
the vimrc OR that i have nvim setup as an IDE-like editor and vim as the quic ,
flexible yet barebones backup.

IPython profiles for different situations. nox profile, autoload pylab profile
etc

fix urxvt because the colorscheme looks normal at first until you launch nvim

either rewrite dmenu or find something better

get comfortable with i3 but once you do i'm excited.

move the readme in this repo over to newbuntu. keep working on those scripts.

if you don't fix the colorscheme and get urxvt to where you want it, then fix
the borders around konsole i don't understand why i3wm has such a strong gtk
feel to it.

both tmux and i3 are scriptable. yet i have no scripts. write something in one
of them that does simple shit like make a window with  a split with ipython and
neovim in the correct environments. actually that'd be medium hard but w/e.

see which one is easier to work with and then make it a full scale thing.

or even use tmuxp for projects or w/e.

once you get to the poitn where your environment is setup as soon as you login,
you won't need conda activate base in your bashrc anymore. in addition you won't
need any user installed packages that aren't in venvs. perfect isolation and a
much more sustainable setup
