# TODO

Didn't wanna resort to a TODO for a dotfiles repo...
But the 2 main branches are still quite different.

09/19/18 {possibly}:
Termux needs to:
~~git checkout Ultisnips/all.snippets~~

***************Come back to see if the above rendered correctly!***************

git checkout .Xresources
git checkout ptpython/config
git checkout everything in .ipython.
The main config is mostly style but there's also around 40 aliases,
and the keybindings file has a lot of notes.

According to last ctime, the above should be from 09/19. Oh well if it's not.
Termux needs to:
git checkout .gitignore
